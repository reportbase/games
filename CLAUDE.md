# games: notes for Claude

A 3D field of boards you fly over, with ~37 games in one page (chess against
Stockfish with a Claude coach, checkers, Go, Tetris, Pac-Man, Sokoban, …), served
by GitHub Pages at https://reportbase.github.io/games/. The owner works through
Claude Code: changes go on a branch, as a PR, and the owner merges. Merging to
`main` publishes.

## Files
- `games.html`: **the whole program and the file to edit.** About 41,000 lines,
  one self-contained page with no build step. Some blocks inside are marked
  "generated, do not edit here" (the inlined field-lib, the runtime assets). Their
  original sources and build scripts no longer exist, so **this file is now the
  source**: edit those blocks in place, carefully.
- `stockfish-18-lite-single.js` and `.wasm`: the chess engine. `games.html` loads
  them as a Worker from beside itself, so they must stay in the same folder. This
  is why the game runs on Pages but has no engine as a single-file chat artifact.
- `index.html`: forwards `/games/` to `games.html`, keeping `?app=…`.

## How the page is put together
- **Apps:** each game is an app object (`CHESS_APP`, `TETRIS_APP`, …), with the
  shared parts in the APP KIT and ARCADE sections. A new app goes into
  `window.FIELD_APPS` (around line 36284) and gets a short id in the
  `[[APP, 'id'], …]` list just below it. The id is what `?app=` uses, and the
  smoke test reaches every app through that list.
- **External services:**
  - the Claude coach talks to the `login.tangent.workers.dev` gateway (the page
    holds no API key)
  - bucket files (piece shapes, pictures) are read from
    `flare.tangent.workers.dev`; games only reads from flare, never writes
- **Libraries** come from CDNs: three.js r128 (cdnjs), chess.js (jsdelivr),
  pdf.js, unzipit and libarchive (unpkg).

## Conventions
- Comments explain *why*, at length, and often quote the owner's request with a
  date, e.g. `(Sep 22: "…")`. There are hundreds of these. Keep the voice: when a
  change follows a request, record it the same way.
- Keep everything in the one file. Don't split it up or add a build step without
  asking.

## Testing
- `npm test` runs `tests/smoke.mjs`: it loads the page in headless Chromium,
  switches to every app in `FIELD_APPS`, and fails on any uncaught error. Run it
  before every PR, and add checks there for new behaviour.
- In a cloud sandbox the CDNs may be blocked. Serve three.js r128 from the npm
  package `three@0.128.0` and chess.js 1.4.0 from `chess.js@1.4.0` with
  `page.route`, as earlier sessions did.

## Related repos
- **3d:** the shape studio; it exports `.tvf3d`, the chess piece format read here.
- **flare:** the storage Worker this page reads buckets from.
- **draw:** the 2D shape editor.
